-Install gcc, make, flex, bison, iconv, gmp, mpfr, mpc
-Extract binutils, gcc-core to Cygwin's /usr/src (for me: C:\dev\cygwin\usr\src)
-Open a Cygwin BASH shell:
-cd ../../dev/C++/MOSS/0.3/cross
-Run the build shell scripts in order.

Problems may be due to:
-A stupid path being used.  echo $PATH and adjust line 32 of /etc/profile accordingly.
-Cygwin's caching.  If something is cached and something changes (e.g. the path), kill the cache files.  Search config.cache and kill everything.  I thought that might fix it, but apparently not.
