## The Minimal Operating System That Sucks

Once, in college, I woke up in the middle of the night and realized I had to write an operating
system.  No delusions, mind, it would almost certainly remain a hobbyist endeavor.  I'd be happy
if I could get anything working.

Since then, MOSS has matured, but still lives up to its acronym: the Minimal Operating System
that Sucks.

## Philosophy

MOSS is designed to be as powerful, but still as clear as possible.  In particular, the main
language is C++, not C, which allows most of the horrible hardware crap to be abstracted into
semi-OO interfaces.  Not all code is up to this standard, since a lot of it was written during
various 04:00 impromptu hackathons, and parts of it are being rewritten, even as the functionality
improves.

## Contributing

MOSS is free for use with attribution, and your pull requests are welcome.  Unfortunately, I
haven't had time to set up a reproducible way of setting things up, and so, like much else in
OS development, it is likely to be painful.
